In this project, using ML tools, we created a rna-seq classification of breast cancer patients.
We uploaded the models with the best accuracy to Drive, and tested the prediction using flask.
We used postman in order to send the data in json format to flask, and got a table with the model predictions for er, pr, her2 and subtype
